# What is XR?
XR is an emerging technology (aka. spatial computing) that:

*   Blends physical and digital worlds
*   Create multimodal, spatial, and immersive experiences and applications

XR is multimodal because it blends visual, haptic, and auditory interactions that are realistic, as far as possible.

XR is also spatial because most interactions are anchored in physical and virtual spaces and environments.

And finally, XR is immersive because it creates realistic and believable worlds that blur boundaries between the real and the digital world.

As an emerging technology, XR has its toolsets worth learning and mastering.
