# What is AR?
AR technology overlays digital content (texts, graphics, images, videos, audio, 3D objects, etc.) over the user's view of the real environment so that the digital content is seen as part of the real environment. The more the digital content blends with the real world the more engaging the AR content can be.

AR technology is the one promising in the XR spectrum because of its simplicity. It does not require headsets or goggles.

## Hand-held AR

Modern smartphones, tablets, and PCs are equipped with capabilities to handle AR experiences and applications. Millions of users around the world have one or more of these types of devices. Thatâ€™s why some of the famous AR applications use hand-held devices.

## Head-worn AR

This type of AR projects digital content into a headset while enabling users to see-through (pass-through).

It is suitable for immersive experiences or where the user needs to perform tasks with their hands. For example, Meta Quest 2 or 3 and Hololens are examples of head-worn AR devices.

## Head-up AR

Head-up AR project digital content into the windshield. For example, in automotive or fighter jets the driver or pilot will have information displayed in their view.
