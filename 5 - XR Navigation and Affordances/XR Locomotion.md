# XR Locomotion
XR locomotion is the technique used to enable movement around in XR environments. It allows users to navigate and explore virtual worlds.

It has two components:

1.  **Translation:** Userâ€™s movement within the virtual environment. This can include walking, running, or using other means to change the user's position
2.  **Orientation:** User's orientation or direction. This can involve turning, rotating, or changing the user's viewpoint to explore the virtual space

For the orientation we can distinguish between **snap turning or continuous turning**.
