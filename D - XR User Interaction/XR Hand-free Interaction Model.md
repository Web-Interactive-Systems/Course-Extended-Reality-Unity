# XR Hand-free Interaction Model
This model includes:

:ref[XR Voice Interaction]{path='/notes'}

:ref[XR Gaze-based Interaction]{path='/notes'}

It can be practical for some scenarios. For example, usersâ€™ hands can be busy, hand fatigue or disability, or tight spaces. In this case, voice- and eye-based interactions can be useful.
