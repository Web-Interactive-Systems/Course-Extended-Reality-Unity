# XR Coordinate System
XR toolkits place virtual objects in the real world so that they look like real objects. To do so, toolkits, rely on **spatial coordinate systems**.

All objects we add to an XR scene have XYZ coordinates. These are cartesian coordinate systems, which can be right-handed or left-handed (Unity is left-handed).
