# XR Spatial Anchors
A spatial anchor is a point in the physical world that is mapped and tracked in both the real world and the virtual world.

Anchors are important to place virtual content in specific locations in the physical environment. This ensures that when users move their devices or change positions, the virtual content stays in place in the real world.
