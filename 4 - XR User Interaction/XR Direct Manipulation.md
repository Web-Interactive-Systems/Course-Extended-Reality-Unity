# XR Direct Manipulation
Direct manipulation is an input model where users use their hands to interact with objects in an XR scene. This is referred to as “near” interaction. This model mimics real-world interactions. For example, a user can poke a button to click it, grab and rotate an object in 3D space, or point and scroll a view.
