# XR Point and Commit
Point and commit an XR model that allows users to target, select, and manipulate **out-of-reach** objects in XR. It is also called “far” interaction. It is unique to XR as we don’t interact with objects this way in the real world. It is a two-state interaction, where first user points with hands (or controllers) and then commits to perform an interaction.
