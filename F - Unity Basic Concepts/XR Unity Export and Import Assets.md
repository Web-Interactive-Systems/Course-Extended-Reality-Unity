# XR Unity Export and Import Assets
When working on a Unity project, often we need to work with assets in two ways:

1.  **Sharing assets**, such as prefabs, materials, scripts, or scenes, with others, or
2.  **Finding assets**, such as prefabs, materials, scripts, or scenes, in other projects, and importing them into our project for reuse

To do this, we can export these assets as a package or assets that we import into other Unity projects

## **Exporting assets**

To export assets in Unity, follow these steps:

1.  Select the asset(s) you want to export. You can select individual assets or multiple assets by holding down the shift key while clicking on them.
2.  Go to File > Export Package.
3.  Choose the file format you want to save the package in. Common formats include .unitypackage
4.  Name your package and choose a location to save it.
5.  Click "Export" to save the package.

## **Importing assets**

Importing assets into Unity is the opposite process of exporting them. When someone sends you a package containing assets, you can import them into your Unity project by following these steps:

1.  Open the Unity editor and go to Assets > Import â€¦
2.  Follow the steps
