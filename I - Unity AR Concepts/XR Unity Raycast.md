# XR Unity Raycast
Raycast is one of the main techniques used for spatial interaction and collision detection in XR. The term "raycast" refers to the process of projecting an imaginary ray (or line)

*   From a starting point
*   Into a specific direction in the 3D space

Raycast enables us to determine what objects or surfaces the ray intersects
