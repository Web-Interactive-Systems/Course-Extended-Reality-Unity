# What is AR?

AR technology overlays digital content (texts, graphics, images, videos, audio, 3D objects, etc.) over the user's view of the real environment to see the digital content as part of the real environment. The more the digital content blends with the real world the more engaging the AR content can be.

AR technology is promising in the XR spectrum because of its simplicity. It does not require headsets or goggles.

This type of AR projects digital content into a headset while enabling users to see-through (pass-through).

It is suitable for immersive experiences or where the user needs to perform tasks with their hands. For example, Meta Quest 2 or 3 and Hololens are examples of head-worn AR devices.
