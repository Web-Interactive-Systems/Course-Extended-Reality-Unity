XR is multimodal because it blends visual, haptic, and auditory interactions that are realistic, as far as possible.

Simply put, multimodality is the technique of using multiple “modes” of presenting and communicating information to audiences. For example, instead of using only text (one mode), a multimodal interface would include a combination of text, emojis, images, video, audio, motion, animation, interactivity, or 3D objects, etc.
