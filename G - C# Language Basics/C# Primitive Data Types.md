# C# Primitive Data Types
There are several built-in primitive data types in C#. Each data type has its range of values and properties (methods). Here are the most important ones:

## Integer types

*   `int` : for integers, whole numbers without decimals, such as 0; 1; 34; 235; -253
*   `byte` : 8 bit unsigned integer (range from **0 to 255)**
*   `short` : 16-bit signed integer (range from −32,768 to 32,767)
*   `long` : 64-bit signed integer (range from 0 and a maximum value of (2^64)-1)

## Floating-point types

*   `float` : for floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 0.34; 124.1; -5.6
*   `double` : same as float but with a higher floating point precision

## Char, boolean, and string types

*   `char` - for single characters (a letter), such as 'a'; 'B'; 'C'. Notice that char values are surrounded by single quotes
*   `bool` - for boolean values either true or false
*   `string` - for text or string, such as "Hello World" or @-quotes, @"Hellow World \n Learning \\\\\\" . Notice that string values are surrounded by double quotes or using the @ symbol (verbatim identifier), which allows escape sequences in a string.
