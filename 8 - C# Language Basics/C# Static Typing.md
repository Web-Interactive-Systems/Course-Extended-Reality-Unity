# C# Static Typing
Static typing refers to a programming language feature where everything is typed. This means that the developers should declare the types of variables, expressions, and functions. The compiler checks the types at compile-time, ensuring that type-related errors are caught before the program is executed.

Most IDEs rely on this feature to provide IntelliSense and better developer experience, such as code completion, content assistance, information about parameters and methods, member lists, and so on.
