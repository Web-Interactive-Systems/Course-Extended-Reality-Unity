# XR Comfort
In the context of XR, "comfort" often refers to creating an immersive and enjoyable experience for users while *minimizing discomfort* and negative side effects. Here are some aspects related to XR comfort:

1.  **Motion Sickness:** Many XR experiences involve simulated movement, which can lead to motion sickness in some users. Designing experiences with smooth motion, reducing latency, and providing reference points can help mitigate motion sickness.
2.  **Visual Comfort:** Some visual design can lead to eye strain and fatigue. Factors such as screen resolution, field of view, and display refresh rate contribute to visual comfort.
3.  **Interaction Design:** User interfaces and interaction methods should be intuitive and user-friendly to enhance the overall comfort of the XR experience. Intuitive controls, accurate tracking, and responsive interactions contribute to a positive user experience.
