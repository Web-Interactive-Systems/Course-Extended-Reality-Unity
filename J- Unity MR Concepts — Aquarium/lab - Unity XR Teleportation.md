# lab - Unity XR Teleportation
The XR Interaction Toolkit provides a set of components for teleportation

Teleportation is a way of navigation where the user jumps from one place to another in the virtual world.

There are two main components to enable teleportation:

**Teleportation Provider**: Allows the user to move instantly from one place to another within the XR environment as if they are teleporting. It relies on the **Locomotion System**.

**Teleportation Area**: This is an interactable. It enables teleportation for a GameObject.
